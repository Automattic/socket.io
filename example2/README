Channel or Chat Room Example.
===========

This is an extension of the original chat example showcasing how one may want to
use channels for communication versus a catch all approach.

The user is asked for their username and the channels they want to subscribe to. 

If users are connected to at least one common channel then they can chat with each
other. Channels can be entered in comma delimeted form.

There is also an example of two APIs
  /api/who - responds with the usernames of who is connected in JSON 
  /api/send - Allows you to send data to a channel. You need to specify the
              following parameters (username, message, publish) where publish is 
              the channel list.

Note: This example is lacking the buffering that is used in the first example.
